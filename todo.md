# ALL DONE

Maybe we can have a alist which is checked against the opened tab list and if its there dont show it, also please implement a checkbox option for the user, to either search through it or nah



in the TabSaerch section , implement c-1 c-2 keymaps to move the tabs from there directly to first second position 


//

1. Improve the keymaps for marks view. 
2. Make it consistent with harpoon, 
3. Add help indications regarding the available shortcuts

in marks JK dont work to move the tabs if the search input is out ?? , can we make it so it works
