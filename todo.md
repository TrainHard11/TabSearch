# ALL DONE

Maybe we can have a alist which is checked against the opened tab list and if its there dont show it, also please implement a checkbox option for the user, to either search through it or nah



in the TabSaerch section , implement c-1 c-2 keymaps to move the tabs from there directly to first second position 


//

1. Improve the keymaps for marks view. 
2. Make it consistent with harpoon, 
3. Add help indications regarding the available shortcuts

in marks JK dont work to move the tabs if the search input is out ?? , can we make it so it works


A command which cycles between current and last tab.
maybe you can make it so i can go  to harpoon using alt+q from alt+a menu?

Implement C-nr -  to move the whichever tab to be moved where you want in the positon /// specifically for harpoon and bookmark

The youtube links , even if they are the same url i wanna see different instances


// Imporve harpoon 

so have two lists of 4 ready for use  and quick switch.
clickable by  1 and 2 

// Fuck it , add an option to add all the existing bookmakrs to my marks list , 
A sync button

// C-S-d to delete all the items in the bookmakrs or harpoon view


// Final HELP page -  please have only as many sections as views 

// Why not, add another manifest.json command to open the main view, so duplicate command.


// Can you somehow make alt+q inside the app to open harpoon view? without so many errors?

// press R to rename the damn bookmark title :)))))))))))
