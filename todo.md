# ALL DONE

IMPLEMENT HARPOON


Let user choose if the the tabsearch we leave the history or we reset and have a new view

Get me a command which removes a tab

Enable a bookmark list , basically let the user to what? search from the booksmarks , 
or allow them to set links where you can also fuzzy saerch them
Maybe we can have a alist which is checked against the opened tab list and if its there dont show it, also please implement a checkbox option for the user, to either search through it or nah



in the TabSaerch section , implement c-1 c-2 keymaps to move the tabs from there directly to first second position 


// Potentioal bugs:

1. Alt+a dont work by default 
2.  default permanent links dont work unless u set a new link then the old ones work as well
3. On some browsers the search navigator dont work
