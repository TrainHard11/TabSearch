# ALL DONE

in marks JK dont work to move the tabs if the search input is out ?? , can we make it so it works


maybe you can make it so i can go  to harpoon using alt+q from alt+a menu?
// Can you somehow make alt+q inside the app to open harpoon view? without so many errors?


// Final HELP page -  please have only as many sections as views 

// Why not, add another manifest.json command to open the main view, so duplicate command.
