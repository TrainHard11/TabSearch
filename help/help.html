		<h3>Harpoon View</h3>
		<p>
			The **Harpoon View** is designed for fast, efficient navigation between a small set of high-priority tabs
			you’re actively working with during a session. In most workflows, you're often juggling 2–4 key tabs
			repeatedly — Harpoon makes switching between them instant and effortless.
		</p>
		<p>
			Think of it as a **persistent, session-focused tab switcher**. You can "harpoon" (pin) up to four important
			links to specific numbered slots—usually accessed with shortcuts like <kbd>Alt+1</kbd> through
			<kbd>Alt+4</kbd>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once a tab is assigned to a slot (e.g., Harpoon 1), you can always jump to it with its shortcut—no matter
			where the tab is in your browser. Even if you close the tab or change its content, the slot stays mapped to
			the assigned URL. You can update the URL or reassign slots at any time, and the shortcut will continue to
			point to the updated destination.
		</p>
		<h4>What you can do:</h4>

		<ul>
			<li>View and manage your active harpooned tabs.</li>
			<li>Jump to harpooned tabs via shortcuts (<kbd>Alt+1</kbd>–<kbd>Alt+4</kbd>).</li>
			<li>Add or update a slot with the current tab.</li>
			<li>Reorder or remove harpooned tabs as needed.</li>
			<li>If the tab is open, switch to it; if not, open it in a new tab.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Keymaps:</h4>

			<li><kbd>Enter</kbd>: Open the selected tab or switch to it if already open.</li>
			<li><kbd>D</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl+D</kbd>, or <kbd>Delete</kbd>: Remove the selected item.</li>
			<li><kbd>Ctrl+T</kbd>: Open full Harpoon view (includes Work & Fun lists).</li>
			<li><kbd>Ctrl+1</kbd> (in full view): Load the Work list into the main Harpoon list.</li>

			<br />
			1. Go to <kbd>chrome://extensions/shortcuts</kbd> for Chromium or <kbd> about:addons </kbd> for Mozzila.
			<br />
			2. Find the extension, "Fuzzy Tab & Search Navigator".
			<br />
			3. Click the pencil icon next to each command and enter your desired keymap.
		</p>

		<h4>The remaining available commands:</h4>
