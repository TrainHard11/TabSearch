		<h3>Harpoon View</h3>
		<p>
			The **Harpoon View** empowers you to create your own set of highly accessible, "persisting" quick-access tabs. The core idea is to let you **"harpoon"** your most critical tabs – often the 1-4 tabs you work with constantly – and assign them a fixed, unchanging quick-access keymap.
			This means you can swiftly switch between these crucial tabs without having to search for them, regardless of where they are in your browser.
		</p>
		<p>
			A key advantage of Harpoon is its **persistence**: once a keymap is set for a harpooned position (e.g., Harpoon_1), that keymap will always point to the URL you've assigned to that position, even if you close and reopen the tab or change the tab's content. You can update the associated link for a harpooned position, and the global keymap will automatically adapt to point to the new location. If the harpooned link isn't currently open in your browser, using the keymap will open it in a new tab; if it's already open, you'll be taken directly to it.
		</p>
		<h4>What you can do:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>View your harpooned tabs.</li>
			<li>Open or switch to a harpooned tab.</li>
			<li>Add the currently active tab to your harpoon list.</li>
			<li>Remove tabs from your harpoon list.</li>
			<li>Reorder harpooned tabs.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Keymaps:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<kbd>F3</kbd>: Toggle Harpoon View.
			</li>
			<li>
				<kbd>ArrowDown</kbd> or <kbd>J</kbd> (when Alt not pressed): Move selection down within the Harpoon list.
			</li>
			<li>
				<kbd>ArrowUp</kbd> or <kbd>K</kbd> (when Alt not pressed): Move selection up within the Harpoon list.
			</li>
			<li>
				<kbd>Enter</kbd>: Open or switch to the selected harpooned tab.
			</li>
			<li>
				<kbd>D</kbd> or <kbd>Delete</kbd>: Remove the selected tab from Harpoon.
			</li>
			<li>
				<kbd>A</kbd>: Add the currently active browser tab to the Harpoon list.
			</li>
			<li>
				<kbd>Ctrl + 1</kbd> to <kbd>Ctrl + 9</kbd>: Quickly activate the harpooned tab at the corresponding position.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Related Global Commands:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<span class="command-name">Harpoon_open</span>: Directly opens the Harpoon view when the extension popup is launched via this command.
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="command-name">Harpoon_add</span>: Adds the currently active tab to your Harpoon list.
			</li>

		<h3>Marks (Bookmarks) View</h3>
		<p>
			The **Marks (Bookmarks) View** provides a dedicated, powerful interface for searching and managing your saved bookmarks. While you can search bookmarks via the Quick Search View, this dedicated view offers more granular control, especially for bookmarks you've specifically marked as searchable within your browser. Its purpose is to allow you to **sync with your existing browser bookmarks** and provide quick access and organization.
		</p>
		<p>
			Similar to Harpoon, if a bookmark's link isn't currently open, activating it will open it in a new tab. If it's already open, you'll be instantly navigated to that tab.
		</p>
		<h4>What you can do:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Search for bookmarks by name or URL.</li>
			<li>Open bookmarks.</li>
			<li>Add new bookmarks from the popup (if enabled in settings).</li>
			<li>Delete existing bookmarks.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Keymaps:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<kbd>F2</kbd>: Toggle Marks (Bookmarks) View.
			</li>
			<li>
				<kbd>ArrowDown</kbd> or <kbd>J</kbd> (when Alt not pressed): Move selection down within the Marks list.
			</li>

				<kbd>ArrowUp</kbd> or <kbd>K</kbd> (when Alt not pressed): Move selection up within the Marks list.
			</li>
			<li>
				<kbd>Enter</kbd>: Open the selected bookmark.
			</li>
			<li>
				<kbd>Delete</kbd> or <kbd>D</kbd>: Delete the selected bookmark.
			</li>
			<li>
				<kbd>A</kbd>: Add the currently active browser tab as a new bookmark (if enabled).
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Related Global Commands:</h4>

			<li>
				<span class="command-name">Bookmarks_open</span>: Directly opens the Marks (Bookmarks) view when the extension popup is launched via this command.
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="command-name">Bookmark_add</span>: Adds the currently active browser tab as a new bookmark.

		<h3>Tab Management View</h3>

		<h3>General Global Commands (Bindable in Chrome)</h3>
		<p>
			These are powerful global commands provided by the extension that you can assign custom keyboard shortcuts to. Unlike view-specific keymaps, these can be triggered from anywhere in Chrome, not just when the extension popup is open. They offer quick access to core browser functions or general extension actions.
		</p>
		<p>
			**Important:** Chrome allows assigning global shortcuts to only a limited number of commands (typically 4). Choose your most critical commands wisely!
		</p>
		<p>
			To bind these commands:
			<br />
			1. Go to <kbd>chrome://extensions/shortcuts</kbd>.
			<br />
			2. Find your extension, "Fuzzy Tab & Search Navigator".
			<br />
			3. Click the pencil icon next to each command and enter your desired shortcut.
		</p>
		<h4>Available Commands:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<span class="command-name">Open_Main_View</span>: Opens the extension popup, defaulting to the Quick Search View. This is often the primary way to launch the extension.
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="command-name">New_empty_tab</span>: Opens a new, empty tab in your current window.
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="command-name">Cycle_tabs_playing_audio</span>: Cycles through your open tabs that are currently playing audio, helping you quickly find the source of sound.

			</li>
			<li>
