Help me modify my code. So im building a chrome extention right now and i want you to change my code like you are a professional programmer and you will write code thats both beautiful and simple to understand and maintain.

I wanna build a new feature called harpoon , please code the solution mainly in the designated files for this feature:


- `Harpoon/harpoon.css`
- `Harpoon/harpoon.html`
- `Harpoon/harpoon.js`

For now lets do something simple. I want a command in manifest so when the user presses alt+q then a popup will appear in the browser, regardless in which the user tab is at that moment telling him: "tab added to harpoon!!"


I want to give you a big part of my code. So  dont respond to the first prompt , wait for the second. Also all the solutions you gon give me, give me all the file code , top to bottom , and dont show me files which require no change.

Codebase popup.js manifest.json popup.html  background.js harpoon.css harpoon.html harpoon.js
